#### Wiener process ####

An intuitive way of understanding [a Wiener process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process) is seeing it as a limit of [random walk](https://github.com/joseprupi/randomwalk). From wikipedia:

Let $$\xi_1$$



$$\lim_{n\to\infty}Pr(|\overline{X_n}-\mu| \geq\epsilon) = 0 \text{  for any  }\epsilon$$
